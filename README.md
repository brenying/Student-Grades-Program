# Student Grades Program

## Objective

The Student Grades project aimed to practice working with C++ structs, arrays, and functions to manage student data. The focus was on inputting student information, assigning letter grades based on test scores, printing student records, and identifying the highest score in the class.

### Skills Learned

- Using C++ `struct` to store related student data.
- Handling dynamic arrays with pointers.
- Implementing functions for input, processing, and output.
- Assigning grades using conditional statements.
- Sorting data to find the highest test score.

### Tools Used

- C++ language features including `struct`, arrays, pointers, and functions.
- Standard input/output streams (`cin`, `cout`) for interaction.
- A basic compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, or Visual Studio) for running the program.
